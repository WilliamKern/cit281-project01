# CIT 281 Project 01

## Overview  
Project 01 was focused on practicing basic JavaScript and terminal skills, specifically using Node.js and the command line. I created a JavaScript program that accepts command-line arguments and manipulates a string by changing its case, reversing it, and trimming whitespace. The project helped reinforce early concepts of JavaScript syntax, `process.argv` usage, and working with strings through a terminal-based workflow.

## Objectives  
- Work with `process.argv[]` to retrieve command-line arguments  
- Use string methods like `trim()`, `toLowerCase()`, `toUpperCase()`, and `split().reverse().join()`  
- Understand the basics of string manipulation in JavaScript  
- Execute JavaScript files via Node.js from the terminal  
- Build confidence in using the command line for input/output testing  

## Deliverables  
- A single `.js` file that:
  - Accepts a string input from the command line  
  - Trims extra spaces  
  - Converts it to uppercase and lowercase  
  - Reverses the order of characters  
  - Logs the output to the console  

## What I Learned  
This project helped solidify the connection between the terminal and JavaScript execution. I became more familiar with retrieving and processing user input from the command line and practiced using basic string methods in a programmatic workflow. It also gave me a strong foundation for writing and testing JavaScript outside of a browser environment.
